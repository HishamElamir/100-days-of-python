# Day 0 - Introduction to Course & Flow

Welcome to the 100 Days of Code Python Course! And I hope that you will learning become way funny with us üòÇüëå.

Course Link (_Arabic_): [GeelMobrmeg - 100 Days Of Python Bootcamp](geelmobrmeg.com)

This is not the first initiative if you checked the internet, but it should be the first Arabic one. We didn't put the documentation in Arabic, because we want you to merge the knowledge between the 2 languages, plus you should be able to surve the wide-world docs which are in English.

Today, we'll cover the basics of what you need to know before diving into Python programming.

## Commitment ü•á
- **Time Commitment**: Dedicate at least 1 hour daily to coding or related activities. This includes coding, reading documentation, or working on projects.
- **Consistency**: Stick to your daily routine. Even on days when you feel less motivated, a short coding session can keep you on track.
- **Accountability**: Find a coding buddy or join a community where you can share your progress and hold each other accountable.
- **Goal Setting**: Set clear, achievable goals for each week or month. This could be learning a new concept, completing a project, or solving a certain number of problems.
- **Review and Reflect**: At the end of each week, review what you've learned, what you struggled with, and plan for the next week.

## Mindset for Learning üéí
- **Patience**: Learning to code takes time. Be patient with yourself. Because early days will be simple and you might think that I can finish 10 days early, we don't want you to burn out yourself. Finishing a day-by-day until the end is way better to start strong and not be able to finish to the end line.
- **Curiosity**: Always ask "Why?" and "How?" to deepen your understanding.
- **Persistence**: Debugging and problem-solving are key skills; don't give up easily.
- **Growth Mindset**: View challenges as opportunities to grow.

## Resources üìö
So, this course will support you mainly with almost the needed matrial, but you should know that this is not enough. You must learn how to search and how to get the information you need from the web. This is why we made part of matrials is to search for something or get to learn from other videos, this is give you the ability to seek and get the information you want. 
But this doesn't mean that we will not cover everything, we will do our best to cover all the programming aspects you should learn and update it frequently.

Now, to make it simple, in the platform (Geel Mobrmeg) you will get resource for the course, which are:
- **Video**: This is the main resource for the course, it will cover all the topics for each day.
- **Code**: You will get the code for each day, so you can practice and learn from.
- **Exercise**: You will get the exercise for each day, so you can practice and learn from.
- **Quiz**: You will get the quiz for each day, so you can practice and learn from.
- **Extras**: You will get the resource for each day, so you can practice and learn from. Such as utils for helping you to learn, extra videos, books or cheatsheet.
- **Community**: You will get the community for each day (Coming Soon).

And we recommend some outside resouces, so you get the ability to see and learn from outside the course. The outside resources are:
- **Books**: 
  - _With the course_: "Python Programming".
  - _With the course_: "100 Days of Python Programming The Book".
  - _Not with the course:_ "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.
- **Online Platforms**: 
  - _Not with the course:_Codecademy
  - _Not with the course:_freeCodeCamp
  - _Not with the course:_edX
- **YouTube Channels**: 
  - _With the course_: Study with me videos
  - _Not with the course:_ Corey Schafer
  - _Not with the course:_ Sentdex

## Daily Routine ‚è≤Ô∏è
So, we recommend having this routin on a daily basis:
- **Morning**: Review concepts from the previous day.
- **Coding Session**: Spend at least an hour coding or solving problems.
- **Evening**: Reflect on what you've learned, plan for the next day.

And we recommend to get a 100 Day Calendar (You will find it in matrials), one the best things is to track your progress. And it will give you motivation to continue and finish all the days.

## Days Breakdown
All days are similar on few concepts, is that you should cover and learn few topics. So, each day will have:
- **Videos**: A set of videos that cover the concepts or topics of the day.
- **Code**: A set of code that you should write to practice and learn from.
- **Exercise**: A set of exercise that you should do to practice and learn from.
- **Quiz**: A set of quiz that you should do to practice and learn from.
- **Reading**: You will find a highlights on the books that we recommend to cover or complete the day topic.
- **Extras**: An _optional_ set of extras that you might find it useful:
  - **Cheatsheet**: You might find a cheatsheet covering a summary of the concepts of the day.
  - **Videos**: You also might find some videos that are not related with the day topic, but you will find it useful on other aspect.

## Repo Structure
The repo will contains almost everything about the course, if you need the materials.
This repo have a simple Structure which for each day will contains markdown file with the day naming `day_{dayNumber}.md`, for example `day_0.md`.
And a directroy with the same structure.

The markdown will contains the day table of content and code examples and some meta information such as links to videos or references.  

## Conclusion üëã
Today's introduction sets the stage for your Python journey. Remember, the key to mastering Python is consistent practice and a willingness to learn. Let's embark on this 100-day adventure together!
