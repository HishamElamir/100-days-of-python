### Running Snippet of Python

```python

```

### What Really Happened

Letâ€™s take a closer look at what Python does when you run the line of code.
As it turns out, Python does a fair amount of work, even when it runs a simple program:

```python
print("Hello Python world!")
```

* What is `print` and what it does?
* Why there's `(` and `)`?
* Why there's `"`?

### Errors You Might Find

The following lines of code, seems to be the same as the one above, but you will find out that they don't work like the one we used.

```python
Print("Hello Python world!")
```

```python
PRINT("Hello Python world!")
```

```python
print{"Hello Python world!"}
```

```python
print("Hello Python world!')
```

```python
print(Hello Python world!)
```
